## Project Overview

**Auth-Clinic** is a Spring Boot application designed to handle authentication and authorization for a clinical system. The app provides a secure way to manage different user roles, such as **admin**, **doctor**, **receptionist**, and **patient**, ensuring that access to clinical data is properly controlled based on the user's role.

The application uses **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for secure authentication and **PostgreSQL** as the database.

### Key Features
- **User Registration**: Allows new users to register with specific roles.
- **Login**: Users can log in and obtain a JWT token.
- **Logout**: Invalidates the user's session.
- **Role-based Access Control**: Controls access to certain endpoints based on the user's role (admin, doctor, receptionist, patient).
- **REST API**: Provides endpoints for registration, login, logout, and data queries.

### Technologies Used
- **Java**: Core programming language.
- **Spring Boot**: Backend framework for creating the application.
- **Spring Security**: Used for authentication and authorization.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Token-based authentication system.
- **PostgreSQL**: Database used to store user data and role information.
- **Hibernate**: ORM framework for database interactions.
- **Maven**: Build tool and dependency management.

### Installation

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/thealexcesar/auth-clinic.git
    ```

2. **Configure PostgreSQL**:
    - Make sure you have PostgreSQL installed and running.
    - Create a database called `auth_clinic`.
    - Update the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file with your PostgreSQL credentials.

3. **Run the Application**:
    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

4. **Access the API**:
    Once the application is running, you can access the API at:
    ```
    http://localhost:8080
    ```

### API Endpoints

- **/auth/register** (POST): Register a new user.
- **/auth/login** (POST): Log in and receive a JWT token.
- **/auth/logout** (POST): Log out the user.
- **/consulta** (POST): Restricted to admin, doctors, and receptionists.
- **/consulta** (GET): Restricted to admin, doctors, and patients.

### Database Configuration

The application uses PostgreSQL as the primary database. Make sure you have PostgreSQL installed and running locally or on a remote server. Update the `application.properties` file with your database connection details:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/auth_clinic
spring.datasource.username=yourUsername
spring.datasource.password=yourPassword
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
